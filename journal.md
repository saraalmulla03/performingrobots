# Entry 3
On Thursday, Toomie & I got started by attaching the servo motor wheels & the 360° wheels to the board. First, we attached the servo motor wheels using nuts, bolts and washers:

Then, we selected an appropriately-sized piece of wood that we cut in half to go under the 360° wheels:

After this, we placed the slab of wood underneath our board, and drilled two more little holes on the sides of the board where the 360° wheels would go, securing them together with screws on either side:

We then secured the 360° wheels underneath the attached slab underneath the board, ensuring that there would be wiggle space between the two wheels. 

After we finalized this, we got to work with starting the Arduino, L298N, and battery attachment process. We drilled 4 holes in the middle-left side of the board around where we wanted the battery to be, attaching it with zipties before cleaning up for the end of class:

## Proposed Robot: Professor Plum
### Trope: 
*Absent-minded professor </br>*
- Academically gifted in the sciences, but socially clueless & unaware of his surroundings.
- He can talk for hours about his latest project, oblivious to how his audience doesn’t understand what he’s saying.
- Often sports a lab coat in inappropriate settings because he forgets to take it off.
- Struggles with social cues and conversations. He might interrupt people, go off on tangents, or completely miss the point of a discussion. Social norms are a mystery to him, leading to awkward or humorous interactions.

[Description from TVTropes.org:](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsentMindedProfessor)

> *This Stock Character is a brilliant scientist but is very flighty. His mind tends to run a mile a minute, he can often struggle to hold a normal conversation, and it's typical for him to become so engrossed in his work that he loses track of just about everything else. Good thing he is good at what he does and often has perfect memory for scientific details or mathematical values.*

## What special features does the robot need? How will we construct it? 
### Cardboard base with *miscellaneous attachments* we hope to construct: 

<strong> Outfit: </strong>
- Loosely fitting, long lab coat (not well tailored) with long dangly sleeves
- Collared shirt & plum-collared tie/ bow tie underneath

<strong> Physical appearance: </strong> </br>
- *Brain sticking out (scrap wire & LED cluster?), under a clear dome (like in the cartoons)— lights up whenever he has an epiphany ("LIGHT BULB")*
- Bigger head relative to body (both of which would be constructed from cardboard)
- Maybe a mustache?
  
<strong> Accessories: </strong>
- Comically large, 70s-style thick-lens glasses
- *Pipe in his mouth that releases steam (maybe a mini fog/ smoke machine inside?)*
