<h1> Clue-inspired Murder Mystery </h1>

<h2> Setting: </h2>
The play would take place in the dining room of a mansion, where each person has something against the victim (i.e., a motive), and which makes each of them a possible suspect. Each character has distinct quirks and secrets that make them equally likely to be the murderer.

<h2> 7 Characters: </h2>
<h3> 6 suspects, 1 victim, and each would be based on a color or trait (we can change the names/ occupations and put our own unique spin on them)  </h3>
1. Colonel Mustard <br>
2. Mrs. Peacock <br>
3. Professor Plum <br>
4. Mr. Green <br>
5. Miss Scarlet <br>
6. Mrs. White <br>
7. Wadsworth (the butler) <br>
<br>
The play would begin with all the characters gathered for a dinner party at the mansion. The victim is introduced, and tension builds as the hidden grudges from each character start to get revealed. Intertwined with scenes of the investigation are flashbacks or monologues from the characters, providing deeper insights into their relationships with the victim. By the end of the act, the victim is found dead, and each character has the chance to defend themselves during a confessional. The audience gets to then vote on who they think did it based on what is presented and the clues at the crime scene.

The Clue movie from 1983 presented a few possibilities of several endings with different possible killers, so we could do that to trick the audience before revealing the actual killer. We should also incorporate elements of dark humor and satire so as to keep the play lighthearted & fun.
